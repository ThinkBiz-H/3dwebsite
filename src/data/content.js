You can't hold it in your hand like a coin or a note — it only exists as numbers on a computer network.Regular money — dollars, euros, rupees — is controlled by a government and its central bank. The bank keeps track of who has how much. Cryptocurrency is controlled by no one. Instead, thousands of computers around the world work together to keep track of who owns what. This shared record is called a blockchain. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, created in 2009. Since then, thousands of others have been created — Ethereum, and many more. Why this matters to you: crypto doesn't work like the money you're used to. There's no bank to call if something goes wrong, no government insurance if you lose money, and no way to reverse a mistaken payment. That isn't necessarily bad — but it's different, and you need to understand the difference before you use it.",
